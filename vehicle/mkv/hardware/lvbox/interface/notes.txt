Fix BSPD MIcromatch

Verify positions of micromatches. 

Generte STL



LCD NOTes

ADD LED Indicator Silk SCreen 

Add "RASP pi Connects on this Side"

Add DNP



Cooling

VCC Trace thickness should be 10 mils

LED Labels for Voltage Indicators

DNP Label r2

Spread out LEDs and associated Labels
Add Pin names to programming LEDs

Be weary of high frequency lines near VCC or going through Vias



GLV BMS
Rotate Programming Pins and Space them out

VCC Traces need to be 10 mils

NO right angles on 12V inputs

Move DNP resistor Label, Add DNP Label

Use D to correct Trace outputs 

Via Grounds instead of traces.

Don't Via Can lines

Make sure your VCC nets are fully conncected

Ground and properly label Buck LEDs

OUtline of board in Edge cuts layer

Fix Silk screen ( add date instead of year/ add rev info)

Ground Traces/ Generally need some clean up
