# Tutorials

Here you will find interactive tutorials on team tools and processes. To follow
along, make a new directory with your olin username under the `workspace/`
directory. There, you can check in your own work to git.

### Contributing

All new tutorials will follow this format:

```
.
|-- tutorials/
|   |-- your_tutorial_name/
|   |   |-- README.md
|   |   |-- assets/
|   |   |   |-- ...
|   |   |-- workspace/
|   |   |   |-- template/
|   |   |   |   |-- ...
|   |   |   |-- follower_username/
|   |   |   |   |-- ...
```

The tutorial content should exist in `README.md`, all data files should exist in
`assets/`. Include a `workspace/` directory for people following the content to
work within, and include a `template/` directory within there for people to copy
to ensure all followers have a starting point.
