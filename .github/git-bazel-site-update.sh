# tasks:
# create a list of board names that have been updated
    # this involves substrings, including the up to ":" and up until ".", only problem is this only applies to .pdf, more cleaning
    # needs to be done on the other file types, maybe further up until suffixes?
# store in a multi-layored dictionary? links to each of the three things that the site links to
    # links can be found by using the suffixes, just need to figure out which suffix corresponds to which link
    # also figure out link format based on jack's shell script
# post request with the elements in the dictionary, along wiht the commit number
