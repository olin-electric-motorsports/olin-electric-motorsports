# Projects

The `projects/` directory will house projects that are under active and volatile
development. This will include things like advanced research projects that won't
make it onto the vehicle during the current season, _as well as_ projects that
are parallel to the car, like the HIL system.

Once a car-related project has matured enough, it will be moved into the
`vehicle/` directory, where development may continue to integrate it into the
vehicle of the season.
