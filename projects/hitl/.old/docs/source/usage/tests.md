# Tests

### Running Tests

While the shell is certainly fun, this system is really built to run tests. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing, which enables a lot of very powerful (but sometimes confusing) functionality. The simplest way to run tests is by navigating to the `tests` directory and running

   `$ pytest`

This will run every single test in the `tests` directory, which might take a while. Pytest has number of ways to specify which tests to run; most commonly, we use pytest markers to specify this. For example, to run only unit tests that don't require any hardware setup, run

   `$ pytest -m "unit and soft"`

To generate a `.html` test report, use the `--report=path` option like this::

   `$ pytest --report=report.html`

For more information on pytest, see the [pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

### Writing tests

This entire repository is built to make writing tests as easy as possible. That said, there is still a learning curve, so it may take a little bit to get the hang of it.

Most tests will consist of 3 main things:

* `get` statements
* `set` statements
* `assert` statements

For example, you might want to set both throttle potentiometers to output 2.5 volts, get the torque request from the CAN bus, and assert that the requested torque is between 100 and 150 Nm. The best way to demonstrate this is with an example

```
def test_throttle(harness):
   harness.io.set_state("THROTTLE_POT_1", 2.5)
   harness.io.set_state("THROTTLE_POT_2", 2.5)

   time.sleep(1)  # We do this to give the hardware time to react

   torque = harness.throttle.get_state("mcTorqueRequest")
   assert 100 < torque < 150
```

You might notice that this test requires a parameter, `harness`. We have already created a pytest fixture `harness`, and pytest knows to automatically deliver a harness to every test that requires one; you don't need to do anything! To learn more about pytest fixtures, read the [pytest fixture docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html#fixture).

If this doesn't make sense, a good way to start is always to copy and paste some other test (probably not a unit test), and edit from there. If you still have questions, please feel free to reach out to awenstrup@olin.edu or anyone else on the HITL subteam.
