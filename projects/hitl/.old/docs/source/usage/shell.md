# The Shell

We haven't built out a command line interface for interacting with our HITL system yet, but we think that the python shell works great! Just run the following commands::

```
$ python
>>> from hitl.roadkillharness import RoadkillHarness
>>> harness = RoadkillHarness()
```

And thats it! You've created a RoadkillHarness object that you can use to control the HITL system. Here are some things you can try:

#### Getting a CAN state from the car

`>>> harness.throttle.get_state("mcTorqueRequest")`

#### Setting a voltage on the car

`>>> harness.throttle.set_state("THROTTLE_POT_1", "2.5")`

If you want to get to know the system more, keep reading or reach out to anyone on the HITL subteam for help.
