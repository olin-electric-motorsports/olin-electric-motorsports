# Setup

DISCLAIMER: This process requires root permissions to edit some files.

### Prerequisites

* A linux system. Due to the hardware interfaces that this project relies on, I STRONGLY recommend against using a virtual machine; this project will not work out of the box on a VM.

* A python environment on your computer. At the very least, you _should_ be able to use the version of python that came installed with your operating system, but I recommend setting up `pyenv <https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/>`_ with virtual environments to isolate this project's dependencies.

### Installation

1. If you haven't yet, clone this repository onto your computer

    `$ git clone https://github.com/olin-electric-motorsports/olin-electric-motorsports.git`

2. Install drivers for the FTDI chip from [this website](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/) and follow the instructions in the `ReadMe.rtf` file.

3. To perform software installation and setup, navigate to the `software` directory
    
    `$ cd olin-electric-motorsports/projects/hitl/software`

4. (Optional) If you want to setup a virtual environment for this project (I recommend it), now is the time. If you don't know how to do this, read [this](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/)

5. Use pip to install the project and its dependencies on your computer. If you usually use `pip3` to invoke `pip`, use that instead; as long as the actual version of `pip` is >=3.7, you should be fine

    `$ pip install -e .`

6. Now that the software is installed, it's time to configure hardware. Navigate to our `scripts` directory and run our hardware setup script

    `$ cd scripts && sudo python hardware_setup.py`

This script installs some linux kernel modules required to interface with CAN hardware.


### Common issues

##### Wrong or mismatched python versions
    
If you're having trouble using pip or python (especially when running with `sudo`), make sure you are using the right python version with `$ which python` or `$ which python3`. When I was setting this up, I noticed I was using the expected python interpreter when I called `python3` or `pip3`, but as soon as I ran `sudo python3` or `sudo pip3`, the python version was different. If this is confusing and you don't know how to resolve it, please just follow the virtual environment tutorial I linked above to setup python >=3.7 on your machine.

##### Missing hardware permissions

If the `hardware_setup.py` script is returning a `no langid` error or similar, it is probably because your user doesn't have permission to get certain information from the USB device. Try running this command with `sudo` (and, as noted above, make sure you are using the expected python version).
