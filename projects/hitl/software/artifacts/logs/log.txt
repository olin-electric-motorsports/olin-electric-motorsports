Hello! This file exists so that git recognizes the log folder (logging can't automatically create it).
I want to make sure everyone has it, otherwise logging will raise an error that may not be obvious how to
fix if you are new to the repository. It's a little jenk, if you know a fix, feel free to fix it!
