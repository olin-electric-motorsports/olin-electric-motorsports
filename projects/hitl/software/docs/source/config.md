# Configuration

After the repository is installed and setup, a `config.ini` file should exist with a default configuration. That said, you may want/need to configure this to your own preferences/needs. The `config.ini` file has 3 sections, detailed below.

## LOGGING

The logging sections outlines basic logging options. **NOTE:** `pytest` ignores these options in favor it its own `pytest.ini` file, so you may have to update those settings as well if you want to alter how `pytest` handles logging. You can also read [pytest's logging configuration documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/logging.html) for more information.

You can also check out the `logging` documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html); it goes over much of the information below in more detail.

#### log_level
    
This option specifies how verbose you want logging to be. The options are (in order) `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`. All logs of the specified order or higher (with `CRITICAL` being most important) will be logged.

#### log_format

This specifies the format of each logged message. Read the logging docs for more information.

#### log_path
    
Where to log to. If you only want to log to the console, use `None`. This option also supports some variables. Specifically, if you use `$LOGS`, it will be replaced with the absolute path to `artifacts/logs`. If you use `$DATETIME`, it will be replaced with the current datetime. If I'm logging to a file, I usually specify this option as `$LOGS/$DATETIME.log`

## HARDWARE

This section includes some hardware-specific options.

#### can_bitrate
    
The bitrate of the CAN bus.

#### can_channel
    
The name of the CAN channel, on your computer. You can see available CAN channels on your linux computer with `$ ip link show | grep can`. This parameter is required by socketcan; venture into the `socketcan docs <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt>`_ if you dare. Otherwise, if you have a PCAN dongle plugged in, `can0` should work; if you don't, you can use `vcan0` to create a fake CAN bus.

## PATHS

This section should be pretty self explanatory; these are the paths the project uses to look for files and devices. These paths should be consumed by the top-level testing object (for example, a `RoadkillHarness`), and passed from there to the objects that need them (for example, an `IOController`).

#### pin_config
    
The path the pin config file (relative to the `artifacts` directory). This file is documented in more detail on the `IOController` page. For example, if your pin config file is at `artifacts/pin_info.csv`, use `pin_info.csv` (NOT `olin-electric-motorsporsts/projects/hitl/software/artifacts/pin_info.csv`)

#### dbc_path

The path your `.dbc` file. Like `pin_config`, this is relative to the `artifacts` directory.

#### can_log_path
    
**This option is not supported yet**
