Introduction
============

Welcome to the OlinHITL homepage! This project was built to enable Olin's Formula SAE team to perform hardware-in-the-loop testing on their car. It isn't quite a python library, and isn't quite a full-fledged application; it lives somewhere in between. If you plan on using this project to write tests, we recommend developing tests inside this projects' ``tests`` directory.
